A few potential excercises for the enige echte.


## 1: Find Rembrandt

Here's a JSON list of paintings, and their artists. Unfortunately, the one making the list isn't very good at using a keyboard, and has made some mistakes writing the artist's names.

Your goal is to find all paintings made by Rembrandt and put them all in one list, which will be printed using console.log into the console. Due to future mistakes, you can't literally check for every option, you will have to approximate the result.

Luckily, we have a function for that already based on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance](Levenshtein_distance)

Some useful tips:

<ol>
  <li>You can loop through the data. Maybe a for loop of a specific kind?</li>
  <li>You could look into a percentage match of the name.</li>
</ol> 


Below is a function that can return something called the "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance".
